[first challenge is understanding the fileserving code at all]

    lib/puppet/file_serving/*.rb
    lib/puppet/indirector/file_*/*.rb
    lib/puppet/type/file/content.rb
    lib/puppet/type/file/source.rb

[requirements for extending the indirector is not obvious, and scarcely documented]
[getting what it's about only possibly thanks to masterzen's blog]
[after adding termini, got in trouble because of special handling of URLs by the indirector]
[worked around by escaping URLs, sound solution not yet devised]
[metadata must be initialized with empty fields]
[passing hash to constructor triggers Ruby bug in 1.9.x]
[inconsistencies among puppet agent vs. apply]
[HTTPS won't Just Work becaust of trust issues]
[mtime as a checksum is not well established, and factually not working (PUP-1208)]
[minor: size cannot be used as extra-light checksum]

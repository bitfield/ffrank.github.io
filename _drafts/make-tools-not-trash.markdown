summary: Some thoughts on the configuration management space
---

One of the most special weeks in Berlin just concluded. It saw
yet another DevOpsDays conference, as well as the first installment
of a CfgMgmtCamp outside of Belgium.

[inspiring moments e.g.]
[- Eric hugging Nathen]
[- Eric sharing Ansible insights]
[- Spencer lauding Ansible features]
[- Felix spreading mgmt and puppet love]

[long felt despair at the divide between Puppet's and Chef's communities]
[talking smack about <not my tool> has a long history]
[Dawn's keynote highlighted this as an ugly side of the config management community]
[describe own history of tech fanboyism (Linux, languages, Puppet...)]

[the road to a more zen view on tech topics]
[- minor revelation: making peace with Windows]
[- increasingly relaxed views on programming languages]
[- indifference towards linux distributions]
[- accepted that my favourites had limitations too]
[ops tools fanboyism stuck for quite a while]
[recently dissipated as well - was it Ansible exposure? chef acceptance? general interest in diversity?]

[a question i heard: do we really want yet another config management tool?]
[-> unique new features though]
[other thing i heard: puppet is so dead]
[-> doesn't sit right with me: puppet is still the most versatile knife in the drawer]

[seeing all the love brought the conclusion: we need a view that embraces tool diversity]
[talking smack makes us defensive, muddles discussion]
[it's still good to mention weaknesses as well as strengths - of your faves as well as others]
[which tool is best? none: each chose its tradeoffs, quite deliberately per usual]
[the puppet-mgmt bridge shows that interoperability can be quite productive]
[ansible is often paired with puppet to get the best of both worlds]

[vendors definitely draw inspiration from their competition (both to clone good parts and avoid bad ones)]
[the communities should open up as much as possible]
[stop feeling part of the <puppet> community as opposed to the others]
[be a jack of all trades, no need to be a master of any]

[some examples of tooling trade-offs (mention own [lack of] proficiencies)]
[puppet and chef share powerful model and fully featured languages]
[salt forgoes language in favor of YAML, adds live management capabilities]
[ansible uses YAML as well, adds agent-less operation and register variables]
[mgmt does embrace language, and eliminates some architectural issues, probably no full support on as many platforms]

[each tool brings some unique strengths to the table]
[professional users and contributors can profit from knowing the respective tradeoffs]
[we can all have more fun by interacting with all communities]
[being more accepting of each others might even further broader inclusivity and diversity]

[everyone start mingling]
[- become mgmt contributor]
[- join the community of a tool you don't (yet) use (be positive there!)]
[- acknowledge the other communities in your meetups etc.]
[- say hi to the others at conferences and other places, and listen to their stories]

[notify me if this was helpful]
[share it with your friends]
